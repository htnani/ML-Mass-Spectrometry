# ML-Mass-Spectrometry
In this project, a dataset of mass spectrometry with 10,000 features and 901 samples was studied(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arcene).

## Goal
- To find effective machine learning models that work well high dimensional dataset when p >> n
- Perform feature selection to have a better understanding of how mass spectrometry data provides insights in cancer prediction
